    "This assignment transitions you from NumPy's numerical array operations to Pandas' powerful tabular data manipulation. While NumPy excels at homogeneous numerical arrays, Pandas is designed for the heterogeneous, labeled data that characterizes most real-world datasets—mixing dates, categories, numbers, and text within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with real bike share data from Chicago's Divvy system to answer questions about urban transportation patterns. Through three progressively complex problems—exploring usage patterns, analyzing rider behavior, and conducting temporal analysis—you'll discover why Pandas has become the standard tool for data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment emphasizes Pandas' design philosophy: named column access, explicit indexing methods (loc/iloc), handling missing data, and method chaining for readable data pipelines. You'll also see how Pandas builds on NumPy while adding the structure and convenience needed for practical data science work.\n",
